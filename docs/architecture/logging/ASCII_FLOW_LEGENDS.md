# ASCII_FLOW_LEGENDS.md

## Canonical ASCII Flow Language
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Scope:** All architecture, execution, and logging diagrams  
**Audience:** Developers, reviewers, auditors, future maintainers  
**Interpretation:** ZERO-AMBIGUITY

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **only allowed ASCII language** for describing
execution flows, error propagation, and responsibility boundaries.

Any diagram in this repository (or extracted libraries) **MUST** comply with
these legends.

❌ No alternative symbols  
❌ No informal arrows  
❌ No implicit meaning  
❌ No interpretation by “understanding the intent”

If a diagram violates these legends → **the diagram is INVALID**.

---

## 2. Core Flow Symbols

### Vertical Flow (Execution Order)

```

|
v

```

**Meaning:**
- Execution continues downward
- Each block represents the next execution step

---

### Horizontal Naming Convention

```

<ClassName>::method()

```

**Meaning:**
- Explicit call
- Caller → Callee
- No hidden side effects implied

---

## 3. Error & Exception Symbols

### Exception Raised

```

X (error)

```

**Meaning:**
- An exception is raised at this point
- Execution flow is interrupted

❗ This symbol **MUST NOT** appear without a defined outcome.

---

### Exception Propagation

```

throws <ExceptionName>

```

**Meaning:**
- Exception propagates upward
- Caller is now responsible

---

### Exception Catching (Explicit)

```

catches <ExceptionName>

```

**Meaning:**
- Exception is intercepted
- Control flow continues from this boundary

---

### Swallowing (Silencing)

```

swallow

```

**Meaning:**
- Exception is intentionally silenced
- Execution continues normally

⚠️ **IMPORTANT RULE**
- `swallow` is **FORBIDDEN** inside libraries
- `swallow` is **ONLY ALLOWED** at **project policy boundaries**

---

## 4. Canonical Failure Flow (Library Level)

```

Caller
|
v <Subsystem>WriterInterface::write(WriteDTO)
|
v
Mysql<Subsystem>Writer (PDO)
|
v
DB
|
X (error)
|
v
throws <Subsystem>StorageException

```

### Interpretation (Locked)

- Library code:
  - ALWAYS throws
  - NEVER swallows
  - NEVER logs silently
- Storage failure is **explicit**
- Responsibility is transferred upward

---

## 5. Canonical Safety Boundary (Project Level)

```

App / Domain code
|
v
Safe<Subsystem>Recorder   (PROJECT POLICY)
|
v
Library Writer            (throws)
|
X <Subsystem>StorageException
|
v
SafeRecorder catches
|
v
swallow   (optional PSR-3 warning)
|
v
Main application flow continues

```

### Interpretation (Locked)

- **Silence is a PROJECT decision**
- Library remains honest and strict
- Logging / warnings are optional and external
- Business flow MUST NOT break

---

## 6. Layer Responsibility Keywords

These keywords are **semantic markers** and MUST be respected.

```

Library

```
- Reusable
- Stateless
- Throws custom exceptions
- No swallow
- No PSR-3 logging

```

Domain

```
- Business logic
- May define policy
- May decide to swallow or escalate

```

SafeRecorder

```
- Explicit safety boundary
- Converts “throwing library” → “best-effort system”
- ONLY place allowed to silence exceptions

```

Application

```
- Controllers / Middleware / CLI
- Must NEVER contain persistence logic
- Must NEVER swallow storage exceptions directly

---

## 7. DTO & Data Flow Rules (Diagram Level)

```

DTO

```
Means:
- Strongly typed object
- Serializable
- Has `toArray()` or equivalent
- NO raw arrays in flow diagrams

❌ This is FORBIDDEN:
```

array

```

If data is passed → it MUST be named as a DTO.

---

## 8. Forbidden Patterns (INVALID DIAGRAMS)

### ❌ Silent Library Failure
```

LibraryWriter
|
X error
|
swallow

```

### ❌ Implicit Catch
```

X error
|
v
continue

```

### ❌ Array-Based Data
```

write(array $data)

```

### ❌ Undefined Error Outcome
```

X error

```
(with no throws / catches / swallow defined)

---

## 9. Mandatory Validation Rules

Every ASCII diagram MUST satisfy:

1. Every `X (error)` has:
   - `throws` OR
   - `catches` OR
   - `swallow`

2. `swallow` appears ONLY:
   - In Project / Domain policy layer

3. Library diagrams:
   - ALWAYS end with `throws <CustomException>`

4. No diagram relies on reader interpretation

Violation of any rule = **Architectural Error**

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

This document is a **language definition**, not guidance.

> If it is not represented here,  
> it does not exist architecturally.
