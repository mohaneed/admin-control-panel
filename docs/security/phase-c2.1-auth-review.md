# 🔒 Phase C2.1 — Authentication Final Review (Verification Record)

## Project
Admin Control Panel

## Phase
C2.1 — Auth Flow Final Review

## Reference Specification
Admin Control Panel – Architecture & Security Specification v1.3.6 (Expanded)

## Date
[YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## 1. Purpose

This document records the **final verification review** of the Authentication Layer
performed in **Phase C2.1**.

> **Phase C2.1 is a verification-only phase.**  
> No code changes, refactors, or behavioral modifications were permitted or performed.

The purpose of this review is to determine whether the Authentication Layer
is eligible for **freeze** following the completion of Phase C1.

---

## 2. Scope of Review

The review covered the **end-to-end behavior** of the following flows:

- Login
- Logout (Phase 13.4)
- Remember-Me (Phase 13.5)
- Scoped Step-Up Authentication
- Recovery-Locked Mode enforcement

Out of scope:
- UI / UX
- Performance tuning
- Feature additions
- Refactoring

---

## 3. Review Methodology

- Read-only audit of the codebase as-is
- No assumptions about intent
- No speculative improvements
- Behavior evaluated strictly against:
    - Canonical Specification v1.3.6
    - Phase C1 Final Locked State
- Any ambiguity treated as a finding

---

## 4. Overall Verdict

**COMPLIANT WITH NOTES**

The Authentication Layer adheres to all mandatory security invariants:

- Deterministic behavior
- Fail-Closed enforcement
- Transactional audit guarantees
- No implicit state transitions
- No bypass or residual verification state

The system is eligible for freeze.

---

## 5. Flow-by-Flow Summary

### 5.1 Login Flow
- Blind-index lookup via HMAC is correct
- Verification state enforced strictly
- Recovery-Locked mode enforced explicitly
- Session creation is transactional
- Audit events are authoritative and complete

**Status:** FULLY COMPLIANT

---

### 5.2 Logout Flow
- Session and Remember-Me tokens revoked transactionally
- Cookies cleared idempotently
- Audit events emitted correctly

**Status:** FULLY COMPLIANT

---

### 5.3 Remember-Me Flow
- Split-token (Selector + Validator) model enforced
- Rotation on every successful use
- Theft detection emits CRITICAL audit event
- Device-bound behavior enforced

**Status:** FULLY COMPLIANT

---

### 5.4 Scoped Step-Up Authentication
- Grants bound to:
    - admin_id
    - session_id
    - scope
    - risk_context_hash
- Strict invalidation on mismatch
- Fail-Closed behavior on lookup failure

**Status:** COMPLIANT (Documented Architectural Deviation)

---

### 5.5 Recovery-Locked Mode
- Login, OTP, and write operations are blocked
- Read-only diagnostics allowed
- CRITICAL audit events emitted on entry, exit, and blocked actions

**Status:** FULLY COMPLIANT

---

## 6. Accepted Notes (Non-Blocking)

### 6.1 Step-Up Grant Storage
- Grants are stored in MySQL (`step_up_grants`) instead of Redis
- This deviates from the original specification preference
- The deviation is **intentional and accepted** due to:
    - Atomic ACID guarantees
    - Authoritative audit consistency
    - Fail-Closed behavior

**Decision:** Accepted architectural hardening. LOCKED.

---

### 6.2 Remember-Me Cookie Semantics
- Login issues a persistent cookie aligned with DB TTL
- Remember-Me middleware issues a session cookie
- Behavior results in immediate re-login via Remember-Me after browser close

**Decision:** Accepted. No security impact. LOCKED.

---
### 6.3 Credential-First Enforcement Clarification

The authentication flow enforces credential verification
prior to any account state evaluation (email verification,
password enforcement, or recovery routing).

This clarification aligns the implementation with
best-practice security posture and prevents account state disclosure.

**Impact:** Behavioral clarification only.
**Freeze Status:** Unaffected.

---

## 7. Freeze Decision

**YES — Authentication Layer is eligible for FREEZE.**

- No blocking findings
- No ambiguous behavior
- No deferred security work

Any future change to Authentication behavior
**MUST be introduced as a new explicit Phase**.

---

## 8. Phase Status

| Phase      | Status              |
|------------|---------------------|
| C2.1       | 🔒 VERIFIED         |
| Auth Layer | 🔒 READY FOR FREEZE |

---

## 9. Sign-Off

This document formally records the completion of **Phase C2.1**  
and authorizes progression to **Phase C2.2 — Auth Documentation Lock**.
